# ðŸš€ Important Deployment Note for Developers
When deploying a Laravel + Vue application on Hostinger, remember that public_html is the default root (index) directory.

ðŸ”¹ Key Deployment Step:
ðŸ‘‰ Rename your Laravel public folder to public_html to ensure your application functions correctly within Hostingerâ€™s directory structure otherwise some of the build files won't work as expected.
